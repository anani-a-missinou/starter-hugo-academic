summary: Leptosphaeria maculans causes stem canker, which is among the most important diseases of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in Europe. Previous genetic studies have identified series of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) involved in quantitative resistance. Resistance QTL contribute to the reduction of crown necrosis at late stem stage (Brun et al. 2010). Cellular mechanisms underlying both basal and quantitative resistance to stem canker are however still largely unknown. In the present work, we used untargeted metabolomic approaches to investigate the cellular responses to stem infection in two oilseed rape varieties, 'Darmor' (partially resistant) and 'Bristol' (susceptible) inoculated with the isolate JN2.  We used direct analysis of tissues by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI), to get access to hundreds of biomolecules analysis while maintaining tissue integrity and molecule localization (Muller, T. et al. 2011). As a complement, a metabolomic approach was conducted using Liquid Chromatography separation coupled with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
