Anani A. MISSINOU is a Junior Postdoctoral Researcher at Institute for Genetics, Environment and Plant Protection (IGEPP). 

His primary research interests lie in understanding genetic determinants of plants-specialized metabolism, interconnected metabolic pathways, and their regulation under stress, especially in crop plants like Brassica species.

The incredible complexity of a plant's specialized metabolism calls for integrative research strategies such as combining innovative plant genotyping and phenotyping pipelines with robust data analysis and modeling tools. My belief is that combining computational tools with the latest biological knowledge will open new horizons for plant research. Thus, I am interested in functional metabolomic and functional genomic approaches that make sense between genome, phenome, and metabolome.

Since July 2022, he will begin a Post-doctoral fellowship on a project aiming uncovering the defense metabolites in Oilseed rape  Introgression Lines valuable for functional Genomics and Breeding of Brassica napus (Diversity, Evolution, and genomics of BIotic interactions team at IGEPP).
